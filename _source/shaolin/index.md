# Shaolin

## My journey and what I've learned

It all started 2019. 

I was searching for an effective way to reduce my stress level. 

First I thought Qigong is like Yoga and therefore nothing for me, but than I found a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/-/en/Shifu-Yan-Lei/dp/0956310109/ref=sr_1_1" target="_blank">Shaolin Qigong book</a> from <a href="https://www.shifuyanlei.co.uk/" target="_blank">Shifu Yan Lei</a> in mid of May and reading it I recognized that he offered online training video courses. 

The next day I started what would become a more than 4 years journey of mind blowing experiences. 

Since than I am training 6 days a week every week. 

Why? 

Because I dont want to miss the huge benefits anymore!

* Much happier
* Less muscle problems
* More muscles
* Less stress
* Calmer in general
* Less weight problems
* More energy
* 50% reduction of repetitive thoughts
* More focused
* Less ill

After doing several different trainings and a 40 days Shaolin challenge with Shifu Yan Lei and learning a lot about Kung Fu training and Qigong I searched for new knowledge and stumbled over a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q0BoMszIow" target="_blank">Qigong Youtube video</a> with Sifu Leo from <a href="https://www.shaolin-wahnam-wien.at/" target="_blank">Shaolin Wahnam school in Vienna</a>. Just before the Covid lockdown in 2020 I traveled there for four days of training and a bit of sightseeing and of course for munching a lot of Manner waffles and wrote <a href="https://bastian-ballmann.de/2020/03/16/shaolin-energy/" target="_blank">a poem about that time</a>. At the school I learned a lot about the absolutely genius Shaolin Wahnam Qigong and especially the exercise Lifting the sky that helped me a lot to calm my mind, learn to let go and refresh my energy.

But I was lacking new learnings about meditation. So I searched the web for it and found a course from <a href="https://dandapani.org/" target="_blank">Dandapani</a> in January 2022. One had to do the course about focus before and that's actually really good, because now I prefer the focus course and have done it twice.

In August 2022 I spent a night in the <a href="https://shaolintempel.ch/" target="_blank">official Shaolin temple of Switzerland in Lucerne</a> and meditated, trained and cooked with them. It was a really cool time. I've learned about a Qigong form that is also teached by <a href="https://shixinggui.at" target="_blank">Shi Xinggui</a>, did some Tai Chi as before in Shaolin Wahnam in Vienna, zen sitting meditation and walking meditation and of course Kung Fu training.

October 2022 I started the <a href="https://www.shaolintreasurehouse.com/" target="_blank">online Kung Fu course from Shaolin Wahnam</a>.

And since April 2023 I am an apprenticeship of the <a href="https://shaolintemple.com/" target="_blank">official Shaolin temple in Yunnan (China)</a>.

Those were not all but the most important steps on my journey.

(Original recipe from <a href="https://elavegan.com/easy-vegan-cheese-sauce-recipe/" target="_blank">elavegan.com</a>)

* 250 ml coconut milk
* 3 Tbsp yeast flakes
* 2 flat Tbsp tapioca flour
* 1 pinch of salt
* 1 pinch of turmeric
* 1 pinch of onion powder
* 1 pinch of garlic powder
* 1 pinch of smoked paprika (optional)
* 1 pinch of chili (optional)

Mix everything in a pot and let it simmer while stirring with a whisk constantly. 

It's ready when it gets stretchy.

You can use it on sandwhiches, in wraps, on pasta, as a dip sauce or for gratinating, but it should be in the oven for not longer than 10 minutes.

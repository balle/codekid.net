# Pizza

## Dough for a pizza steel or stone in a domestic oven

* 1 kg pizza flour
* 650 ml warm water
* 20g of salt
* 1-2g fresh yeast
* 20g olive oil

Traditionally everything is mixed using your hands.

First mix the salt into the water, than mix 10% (50g) of the flour into it.

Now insert the yeast (use 2g if it's cold and 1g if it's hot) and mix until it has vanished.

Afterwards put some flour into the water and stir until it has combined with the rest. Do so with the left over flour until a firm dough has been formed.

Pour the olive oil over the dough, cover it and let it sit for 10 minutes.

Now you work the dough until the olive oil has nearly been absorbed and until you can press it and it comes up immediately.

Let it rest again for at least 16 hours.

Form 6 pizza balls and let them rest again for at least 1 better 2-3 hours.

Preheat the oven at max temparature (e.g. 275C)

Press and form it to a round pizza and put 1-2 Tbsp of pizza sauce onto it.

Prebake the pizza for 3 minutes on a preheated pizza tray or for 2 minutes on a preheated pizza stone or -steel. 

Than put the other ingredients on top, drizzle some olive oil over it and bake for another 5-6 minutes.

Add the grill function if you can and substract a minute from the last baking time.

## Pizza sauce

* 1 can chopped or peeled tomatos
* 1 pinch of salt
* Fresh basil (optional)
* Oregano (optional)

Puree the tomatos using a handblender, add a pinch of salt and basil or oregano if you like. 

If the puree is too watery add some tomato puree to make it a slightly thick sauce.

Do not cook the sauce as it will cook in the oven.

Traditionally peeled tomatos are used for the sauce and crushed by hand.

## Dough for baking on a grate

* 500 g pizza flour
* 325 ml warm water
* 10 g salt
* 3 g fresh yeast
* 10 g olive oil

Combine the dough as described for the domestic oven dough, but let it rest in a warm spot for 16 hours.

Cut it into half, form the two pieces to dough balls and let them sit covered for another 1-2 hours. Than form your pizza and preheat the oven on max temperature. Transfer the pizza dough on the back of your hands onto a baking paper on the grate, put tomato sauce on top and prebake it for three minutes on the lowest rack.

Get the pizza out, put the toppings and the cheese on top, drizzle some olive oil over it and bake it for another 5 minutes on the highest rack. Add the grill function or otherwise add 1 minute to the baking time.

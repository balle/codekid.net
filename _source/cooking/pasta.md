# Pasta recipes

## Italian pasta rules

- The sauce must be ready before the noodles are cooked
- Salt the pasta water well when it's cooking (e.g. 1 tbsp coarse salt)
- You shall not put oil in the water or on the pasta! Otherwise it cannot absorb the sauce!
- The water must be cooking before you insert the pasta
- The water must be bubbling all the time as the pasta wants to dance in it
- Therefore the pot must be big enough. No one wants to dance in an overfilled disco.
- Cook the pasta al dente (like described on the package)
- Get a cup of pasta water before you drain the pasta
- The pasta must be mixed with the sauce immediately!
- Depending on the sauce thickness pour some pasta water into the pasta / sauce mix to help it combine

## How to use pesto

Pesto should be mixed with pasta water to give a creamy sauce otherwise it's too oily. 

Depending on the pesto half to same amount of water is used.

## How to recognize good pasta

* It should not be orange. The brighter (color of the dough) it has the better
* The surface should be rough
* It should absorb the sauce

## Tomato sauce

* 1 can chopped or peeled tomatos
* 1 clove of garlic
* 4 Tbsp of olive oil
* 1 pinch of salt
* Fresh basil (optional)

Press the garlic into the olive oil and let it simmer for 2-3 minutes. 

Blend the tomatos in a blender, add a pinch of salt and pour it into the olive oil.

Let it cook on low heat for about 5 minutes, stir from time to time.

When the sauce is ready insert the basil plucked by hand. 

Instead of basil you can also add fried eggplant or fried zucchini or tofu feta and olives or... :)
